I love learning and am always looking for problems to solve and things to create. I've used programming to contribute to open source code and spread my love of programming through hackathons and summer programs (spent sophomore summer teaching Scratch to kids). I've helped CodersForSanders with website design and data entry, and even tried creating software for restaurants (both incredibly difficult tasks and great learning experiences).</p>
