				<h2>How to Start Learning to Code</h2>
				<p>The journey of a thousand steps... and the first one is always the hardest. Programming is an important thing to know in today's society, not only because it offers lucrative career opportunities and freedom to pursue one's own ideas, but also because it's important to know how something as ubiquitous as the internet works. Here's how I started as a self-taught coder.
				</p>
				<p>
				Programming can seem so daunting if you don't really know how it works. Even after around 2 years of on and off learning, I still get cold feet learning a completely new language, because of how big a task it seems like it is. I know that I'm certainly no expert, but while being a newbie is still fresh in my mind, I'd like to give advice on how to get started with coding.
				</p>
				<p>
				The quickest and, really, the only way, to learn programming is not to read books, learn theory, or watch tutorials, but to JUMP IN. It's hard when you truly have no idea what you're doing, but the best way to learn is by doing, not by watching. If you have no idea what HTML means, what a text editor or IDE is, or the difference between front end and back end development, it's easy to get overwhelmed at the very beginning and just not know where to go.
				</p>
				<h4>First Off, How Do Websites Work?</h4>
				<p>I still don't understand completely all the technicalities, and I'm not going to pretend like I do. You should know, however, what's occurring behind the scenes when you enter a website name into your browser.

				</p>
				<p>1. The browser asks a web server (the thing you pay to store your files and host your website) for the files associated with that domain name.</p><p>
				2. The browser receives the associated files and renders them on the screen.</p><p>
				3. HTML files are like instructions for what is on a page. CSS files decorate and make things pretty on the page. Any javascript files will give instructions for what happens when the user clicks a button or other dynamic things.</p><p>
				4. When you submit information (such as an email into a form), this info goes back to the web server to be stored for later use.
				</p>
				<h4>Try it Out!</h4>
				<p>You can make your own website in one minute if you wanted - no money or anything necessary. You'd be using your own computer as a web server. This will allow only your local computer to access these files and render the website though. If you wanted others to be able to see your website, you'd have to pay for web hosting from other fast, large servers.</p>
				<p>Simply go to notepad or notepad++ (and if you want to get really advanced, download a free text editor such as Sublime Text, which is what I use), and type in: Hello World!
				</p>
				<p>Save this file as: hello.html and then find it in your files and double click to open it in a browser.</p>
				<p>And you'll see it pop up in your (hopefully Chrome) browser! Your very own website that you just made yourself, more or less exactly how Facebook or Netflix started! (sort of, lol)</p>
				<p>What are you looking at, exactly? Well, if you look at the address bar, you'll see the path to your file. This means that you requested that file from your computer, and the browser went to look for whatever was in that file and used it to create a website. Now, it only found instructions to write "Hello World", so that's what it did. The way to get Hello World to be in the center of the screen is only 5 seconds of work, as is the code to make it red (both are CSS AKA decorating code). The way to add a form asking for your name is another minute of code. The program to add a link to a picture is another 20 seconds of learning. And soon, you'll be creating functional websites as advanced as Reddit.com!</p>
				<h4>Now What?</h4>
				<p>Well, you just made your first website! Does that make you a programmer? Well, a bad one, but yes! Keep learning new things and you'll start being able to create things from imagination soon. Start with tutorials online - follow along but make sure to not copy and paste, but type everything. You don't need to understand what it does, but make sure you're typing it letter by letter and forcing your brain to try to make sense of it. After a certain amount of competency (lower than you think!), brainstorm your own project and begin creating it using StackOverflow and Google! Look up anything you don't know and make that idea become reality! It's not a startup, merely a learning opportunity and possible capstone project or resume booster. </p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
