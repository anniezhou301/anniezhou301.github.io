<h2>Cinnamon Is My Favorite Spice</h2>
<p class="blog">In the vegetable soup of life, variety would be the oregano, the thyme, the paprika, the basil. The carrots are going to be bland if you don’t add salt; the chickpeas tasteless without black pepper. Not falling into routine, and actively seeking out new experiences is what makes life exciting and interesting, and more or less worth living. I have enough trouble eating vegetable soup as it is, I have no desire to try it cut down to a dull watery paste that Gordon Ramsey wouldn’t even use to feed his chickens. I try my hardest to keep new experiences bountiful in my life, and have found it to be more or less a key to happiness.</p>
